# NYC Water Consumption Over Time (NYC OpenDataPortal)
- Tools Utilized: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib(pyplot), Spyder IDE

## About Dataset:
- https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Water-Consumption-in-the-City-of-New-York/ia2d-e54m/about_data
- Historical data: Water consumption in the New York City Water Supply System (Based on New York City Census population)
- Analysis was done when data was last updated: May 1, 2024

## About Project:
- Utilized Python and Pandas library to analyze NYC Water Consumption data sourced from the NYC OpenData Portal.
- Calculated average water consumption by decade (1980s to 2020s) to identify consumption trends.
- Determined median water consumption in the 1990s for further insight into historical patterns.
- Implemented analysis to ascertain if water consumption per capita increased, decreased, or remained stable compared to the previous year.
- Computed total cost per water processing per decade for comprehensive financial assessment.

## Visualizations:
- Graphed the NYC water consumption over the years.
  - Graph clearly shows that the gallons consumed per day decreased over the years.
- Graph the NYC population over the years

- Concluded that NYC’s initiatives to curtail water consumption have proven effective, with average consumption witnessing a consistent decrease across successive decades.
