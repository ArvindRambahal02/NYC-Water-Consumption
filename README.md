- Determined median water consumption in the 1990s for further insight into historical patterns.
- Implemented analysis to ascertain if water consumption per capita increased, decreased, or remained stable compared to the previous year.
- Computed total cost per water processing per decade for comprehensive financial assessment.

- Concluded that NYCâ€™s initiatives to curtail water consumption have proven effective, with average consumption witnessing a consistent decrease across successive decades.
